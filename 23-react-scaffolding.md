### NEXT JS 
----
Next.js is a full-stack React framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size—from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Next.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports a static export which doesn’t require a server.


### VITE
---
Next Generation Frontend Tooling Get ready for a development environment that can finally catch up with you [See more](https://vitejs.dev/)
```
npm create vite@latest
```

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

* A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

* A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box. Read about what's possible in the Features Guide. Support for frameworks or integration with other tools is possible through Plugins. The Config Section explains how to adapt Vite to your project if needed.
